Breeze is a set of tools that aims to make lisp development easier.

It is not production-ready.

Please read the [documentation](https://fstamour.gitlab.io/breeze/).

## Upstream

The original project was not proprietary, nor is that the intent of
this nor any downstream fork; if you wish to incentivise development,
please keep the tool's users invested in its applicability.
